# Smart-queuing-system-udacity-Intel-IOT
This project is a part of Intel IOT Nanodegree of Udacity. The aim of this project to propose the most suitable hardware for 3 different scenarios. Build out the application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types.
All the three scenarios include queuing system based on different sectors in real world  where edge devices are typically deployed.
The three scenarios are:

Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector:
The description for the Manufacturing Sector in present in [Manufacturing Sector.md](https://github.com/AarthiAlagammai/Smart-queuing-system-udacity-Intel-IOT/blob/master/Manufacturing%20Sector.md)

Scenario 2: Retail Sector
The description for the  Retail Sector in present in [Retail Sector.md](https://github.com/AarthiAlagammai/Smart-queuing-system-udacity-Intel-IOT/blob/master/Retail%20Sector.md)

Scenario 3: Transportation Sector
The description for the Transportation Sector in present in[Transportation Sector.md](https://github.com/AarthiAlagammai/Smart-queuing-system-udacity-Intel-IOT/blob/master/Transportation.md)

The final hardware choosen for each of the scenario is present in [choose-hardware-proposal](https://github.com/AarthiAlagammai/Smart-queuing-system-udacity-Intel-IOT/blob/master/choose-the-right-hardware-proposal-template%20(1).pdf)
